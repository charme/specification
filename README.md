# The Charme Specification
***Charme*** is a new JSON-based API format. It's the French word for charm, or "the ability to persuade, delight or arouse admiration", and this is the best description for the aim of this specification: An API format that solves your problems. Simple and easy to use, reliable in all situations, and enterprise oriented with features to fulfill the requirements of huge, more complex APIs. It's inspired by JSON API, but eliminates its known limitations and problems.

## Some goals, defined so far
- Simplicity, reliability
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous requests
- Support for bulk request
- Not limited to the HTTP protocol
- Internationalization and localization
- JSON-LD integration
- ...

## Be a part of it!
The project just started, and a first preview version of the spec will be published as soon as possible. Nevertheless you can tell us which limitations of other API formats like JSON API are currently a problem for you - simply create an issue for it, explain the problem and suggest a solution that would solve the problem for you.
