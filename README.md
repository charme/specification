# The Charme Specification
`Charme` is a new JSON-based API format specification. It's compareable to JSON API, but eliminates the known limitations and problems there, and it's better prepared for enterprise usage.

## Some goals, defined so far
- Not limited to the HTTP protocol
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous requests
- Support for bulk request
- JSON-LD integration
- Simplicity, reliability
- Unicode support
- ...

## Be a part of it!
The project just started, and a first preview version of the spec will be published as soon as possible. Nevertheless you can tell us which limitations of other API formats like JSON API are currently a problem for you - simply create an issue for it, explain the problem and suggest a solution that would solve the problem for you.
